Do things in Parentheses First

yes	 	4 × (5 + 3)	=	4 × 8	=	
32
 
not	 	4 × (5 + 3)	=	20 + 3	=	
23
(wrong)

Exponents (Powers, Roots) before Multiply, Divide, Add or Subtract

yes	 	5 × 22	=	5 × 4	=	
20
 
not	 	5 × 22	=	102	=	
100
(wrong)

Multiply or Divide before you Add or Subtract

yes	 	2 + 5 × 3	=	2 + 15	=	
17
 
not	 	2 + 5 × 3	=	7 × 3	=	
21
(wrong)

Otherwise just go left to right

yes	 	30 ÷ 5 × 3	=	6 × 3	=	
18
 
not	 	30 ÷ 5 × 3	=	30 ÷ 15	=	
2

How Do I Remember It All ... ? PEMDAS !
P
Parentheses first
E
Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD
Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS
Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Divide and Multiply rank equally (and go left to right).

Add and Subtract rank equally (and go left to right)

So do it this way:

pemdas
After you have done "P" and "E", just go from left to right doing any "M" or "D" as you find them.

Then go from left to right doing any "A" or "S" as you find them.

Note: in the UK they say BODMAS (Brackets,Orders,Divide,Multiply,Add,Subtract), and in Canada they say BEDMAS (Brackets,Exponents,Divide,Multiply,Add,Subtract). It all means the same thing! It doesn't matter how you remember it, just so long as you get it right.
