Lab due Sep 27, 2021 11:40 +06

Write a function for determining if a year is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar.
The system is to check if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless it is also divisible
by 400.

For example, 1896, 1904, and 2000 were leap years but 1900 was not.
Write a function that takes in a year as input and returns True if the year is a leap
year, return False otherwise.

Note: background on leap year https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year

The name of the function should be isleapyear and the function should take one parameter which is the year to test.  Here is an example call to the function

int mybirthyear = 2000 

If( isleapyear(mybirthyear)) {

    printf(“Year %i  was a leap year”,mybirthyear)

}

File Name 

isleapyearf.cpp

Function Signature

bool isleapyear(int inyear);

Body mass index (BMI) is a number calculated from  a person’s weight and height.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the BMI is a fairly
reliable indicator of body fatness for most people. BMI does not measure body fat
directly, but research has shown that  BMI correlates to direct  measures  of  body  fat,  
such  as  underwater  weighing  and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The formula 
for BMI is
    Weight/Height2

Where    weight is in kilograms    and height is in meters.

The name of the function should be named bmimetricf and the function should take two parameters which are the weight in kilograms and the height in meters to use to calculate the BMI..  Here is an example call to the function

int weight = 50;

float height = 1.58;

printf(“BMI is: %3.2f”,bmimetricf(weight, height)) ;

The output of the code above would be: BMI is: 20.03

File Name 

bmimetricf.cpp

Function Signature

float bmimetricf(int weight, float height);

Max In List Function

Lab due Oct 16, 2021 03:40 +06
Implement function maxinlst(lst), which returns the maximum value of the elements in the array.
For example, given an array lst: [-19, -3, 20, -1, 5, -25], the function
should return 20.


The name of the method should be maxinlst and the method should take two parameters.  The first parameter is the array of values to test.  The second parameter is the number of elements in the array. Here is an example call to the function

int lst[] = {-19, -3, 20, -1, 5, -25};

printf(“%i”,maxinlst(lst,6));

File Name 

maxinlst.cpp

Function Signature

int maxinlst(int lst[], int size);




Score

There are three tests each worth 2 points

Note: You do not need to submit any other code including  the main method or any print statements. ONLY the maxinlst function is required. Otherwise, the autograder will fail and be unable to grade your code. (I.e., do not include the above example in your code.) The above example should be used to test your code but deleted or commented out upon submission.

Max Absolute In List Function

Lab due Oct 16, 2021 03:40 +06
Implement function maxabsinlst(lst), which returns the maximum absolute
value of the elements in the array.
For example, given a array lst: [-19, -3, 20, -1, 0, -25], the function
should return 25.

The name of the method should be maxabsinlst and the method should take two parameters.  The first parameter is the array of values to test.  The second parameter is the number of elements in the array. Here is an example call to the function

int lst[] = {-19, -3, 20, -1, 5, -25};

printf(“%i”,maxabsinlst(lst,6));

Average of List Function
Lab due Oct 16, 2021 03:40 +06
Implement function avgoflst(lst), which returns the average
value of the elements in the array.
For example, given a array lst: [19, 2, 20, 1, 0, 18], the function
should return 10.


The name of the method should be avgoflst and the method should take two parameters.  The first parameter is the array of values to test.  The second parameter is the number of elements in the array. Here is an example call to the function

int lst[] = {19, 2, 20, 1, 0, 18};
