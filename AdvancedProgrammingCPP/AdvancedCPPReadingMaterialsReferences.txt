Lab due Sep 27, 2021 11:40 +06

Write a function for determining if a year is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar.
The system is to check if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless it is also divisible
by 400.

For example, 1896, 1904, and 2000 were leap years but 1900 was not.
Write a function that takes in a year as input and returns True if the year is a leap
year, return False otherwise.

Note: background on leap year https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year

The name of the function should be isleapyear and the function should take one parameter which is the year to test.  Here is an example call to the function

int mybirthyear = 2000 

If( isleapyear(mybirthyear)) {

    printf(“Year %i  was a leap year”,mybirthyear)

}

Body mass index (BMI) is a number calculated from  a person’s weight and height.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the BMI is a fairly
reliable indicator of body fatness for most people. BMI does not measure body fat
directly, but research has shown that  BMI correlates to direct  measures  of  body  fat,  
such  as  underwater  weighing  and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The formula 
for BMI is
    Weight/Height2

Where    weight is in kilograms    and height is in meters.

The name of the function should be named bmimetricf and the function should take two parameters which are the weight in kilograms and the height in meters to use to calculate the BMI..  Here is an example call to the function

int weight = 50;

float height = 1.58;

printf(“BMI is: %3.2f”,bmimetricf(weight, height)) ;

The output of the code above would be: BMI is: 20.03

File Name 

bmimetricf.cpp

Function Signature

float bmimetricf(int weight, float height);

Max In List Function

Lab due Oct 16, 2021 03:40 +06
Implement function maxinlst(lst), which returns the maximum value of the elements in the array.
For example, given an array lst: [-19, -3, 20, -1, 5, -25], the function
should return 20.


The name of the method should be maxinlst and the method should take two parameters.  The first parameter is the array of values to test.  The second parameter is the number of elements in the array. Here is an example call to the function

int lst[] = {-19, -3, 20, -1, 5, -25};

printf(“%i”,maxinlst(lst,6));

The name of the method should be maxabsinlst and the method should take two parameters.  The first parameter is the array of values to test.  The second parameter is the number of elements in the array. Here is an example call to the function

BMI Metric With Status Category

ab due Oct 28, 2021 14:20 +06

Modify your earlier BMI Metric program to also display the CDC standard weight status categories:

The CDC standard weight status categories are:

BMI
	

Weight Status

Below 18.5
	

Underweight

18.5-24.9
	

Normal

25.0-29.9
	

Overweight

30.0 and above
	

Obese



For example,  an  execution could look  like  this:
Please enter weight in kilograms: 50
Please enter height in meters: 1.58
BMI is: 20.03, Status is Normal

Cash Register


Lab due Oct 28, 2021 14:20 +06

Write a program that computes how much a customer has to pay after purchasing
two items. 

The price is calculated according to the following rules:
• Buy one get one half off promotion: the lower price item is half price.
• If the customer is a club card member, additional 10% off.
• Tax is added.


Inputs to the program include:
• Two items’ prices
• Have club card or not (User enters ‘Y’ or ‘y’ for “yes”; ‘N’ or ‘n’ for “no”)
• Tax rate (User enters the percentage as a number; for example, they enter
8.25 if the tax rate is 8.25%)

Program displays:
• Base price - the price before the discounts and taxes
• Price after discounts - the price after the buy one get one half off promotion
and the member’s discount, if applicable
• Total price – the amount of money the customer has to pay (after tax)
printed with the precision of 2 decimal digits.

Hint: In order to print a number in a specific precision, you can use the round
function passing 2 arguments to it. To format to two decimal places you can use the printf function with the format of 2.2f.

For example, an execution could look like this:

Enter price of the first item: 10
Enter price of the second item: 20
Does customer have a club card? (Y/N): y
Enter tax rate, e.g. 5.5 for 5.5% tax: 8.25
Base price = 30.00
Price after discounts = 22.50
Total price = 24.36

Call Cost Calculator



Lab due Oct 28, 2021 14:20 +06

Write a program that computes the cost of a long-distance call. The cost of the call is
determined according to the following rate schedule:
• Any call started between 8:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M., Monday through Friday, is
billed at a rate of $0.40 per minute.
• Any call starting before 8:00 A.M. or after 6:00 P.M., Monday through Friday, is
charged at a rate of $0.25 per minute.
• Any call started on a Saturday or Sunday is charged at a rate of $0.15 per
minute.
The input will consist of the day of the week, the time the call started, and the length
of the call in minutes.
The output will be the cost of the call.

Notes:
1. The time is to be input as 4 digit number, representing the time in 24-hour
notation, so the time 1:30 P.M. is input as 1330
2. The day of the week will be read as one of the following three character string:
‘Mon’, ‘Tue’, ‘Wed’, ‘Thr’, ‘Fri’, ‘Sat’ or ‘Sun’
3. The number of minutes will be input as a positive integer.

For example, an execution could look like this:


Enter the day the call started at: Fri
Enter the time the call started at (hhmm): 2350
Enter the duration of the call (in minutes): 22
This call will cost $5.50

String Splitter


Lab due Oct 28, 2021 14:20 +06

Read from the user a string containing 
odd number of characters. Your program should: 
a) Print the middle character. 
b) Print the string up to but not including the middle character (i.e., the first half 
of the string). 
c) Print the string from the middle character to the end (not including the 
middle character). 

Sample output: 
Enter an odd length string: Fortune favors the bold
Middle character: o
First half: Fortune fav
Second half: rs the bold

Write a program that  reads a character (string of  length  1)  from  the 
user, and classifies it to  one of the following: lower case letter, upper case letter, 
digit,  or non-alphanumeric character 

Sample  output (4 different executions):  
Enter a character: j
j is  a lower case  letter.
Enter a character: 7
7 is  a digit.
