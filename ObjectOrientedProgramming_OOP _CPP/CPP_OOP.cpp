You can use the OS commands to clear the contents of the console.

#include<stdlib.h>
int main(){

system("cls");   //For windows
system("clear"); //For Linux

}

This is actually a quite simple problem. All you have to do is use printf. You don't even need printf or any headers, for that matter.

printf("\e[1;1H\e[2J");
The \e[1;1H sets the screen to the 1st row and 1st column. the 2J overwrites all characters currently on the screen.

You can also use this:

write(0,"\e[1;1H\e[2J",12);
Then you don't need stdio.h.

/*
system("pause");
is wrong because it's part of Windows API and so it won't work in other
operation systems.

You should try to use just objects from C++ standard library.
A better solution will be to write:

cin.get(); ///  cin.get();  // or getchar() or _getch();
return 0;
But it will also cause problems if you have other cins in your code.
 Because after each cin, you'll tap an Enter or \n which is a white space character. cin ignores this character and leaves it in the buffer zone but cin.get(), gets this remained character. So the control of the program reaches the line return 0 and the console gets closed before letting you see the results.
To solve this, we write the code as follows:
cin.ignore();
cin.get();
return 0;

You can use std::cin.get() from iostream:

#include <iostream> // std::cout, std::cin
using namespace std;

int main() {
   do {
     cout << '\n' << "Press the Enter key to continue.";
   } while (cin.get() != '\n');

   return 0;
}

 cin.get();  // or getchar()

Similarly, in C language, getchar() can be used to pause
 the program without printing the message Press any key to continue.
