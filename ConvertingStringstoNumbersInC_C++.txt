Converting Strings to Numbers in C/C++

There are two common methods to convert strings to numbers: 
 

Using stringstream class or sscanf() 
stringstream() : This is an easy way to convert strings of digits into ints, floats or doubles. Following is a sample program using a stringstream to convert string to int.
 


// A program to demonstrate the use of stringstream
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    string s = "12345";
 
    // object from the class stringstream
    stringstream geek(s);
 
    // The object has the value 12345 and stream
    // it to the integer x
    int x = 0;
    geek >> x;
 
    // Now the variable x holds the value 12345
    cout << "Value of x : " << x;
 
    return 0;
}
Output:

Value of x : 12345
// A stringstream is similar to input/output
// file stream. We need to declare a stringstream
// just like an fstream, for example: 
stringstream ss;

// and, like an fstream or cout, 
// we can write to it:
ss << myString; or 
ss << myCstring; or
ss << myInt;, or float, or double, etc.

// and we can read from it:
ss >> myChar; or
ss >> myCstring; or
ss >> myInt;  
To summarize, stringstream is a convenient way to manipulate strings.
sscanf() is a C style function similar to scanf(). It reads input from a string rather that standard input. 
 


#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    const char *str = "12345";
    int x;
    sscanf(str, "%d", &x);
    printf("\nThe value of x : %d", x);
    return 0;
}
Output:



Value of x : 12345
Similarly we can read float and double using %f and %lf respectively.

String conversion using stoi() or atoi() 
stoi() : The stoi() function takes a string as an argument and returns its value. Following is a simple implementation:
 


// C++ program to demonstrate working of stoi()
// Work only if compiler supports C++11 or above.
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    string str1 = "45";
    string str2 = "3.14159";
    string str3 = "31337 geek";
 
    int myint1 = stoi(str1);
    int myint2 = stoi(str2);
    int myint3 = stoi(str3);
 
    cout << "stoi(\"" << str1 << "\") is "
         << myint1 << '\n';
    cout << "stoi(\"" << str2 << "\") is "
         << myint2 << '\n';
    cout << "stoi(\"" << str3 << "\") is "
         << myint3 << '\n';
 
    return 0;
}
Output:

stoi("45") is 45
stoi("3.14159") is 3
stoi("31337 geek") is 31337 
atoi() : The atoi() function takes a character array or string literal as an argument and returns its value. Following is a simple implementation:
 


// For C++11 above
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;
  
int main()
{
    const char *str1 = "42";
    const char *str2 = "3.14159";
    const char *str3 = "31337 geek";
    
    int num1 = atoi(str1);
    int num2 = atoi(str2);
    int num3 = atoi(str3);
   
    cout << "atoi(\"" << str1
              << "\") is " << num1 << '\n';
    cout << "atoi(\"" << str2
              << "\") is " << num2 << '\n';
    cout << "atoi(\"" << str3
              << "\") is " << num3 << '\n';
    
   return 0;
}
Output:

atoi("42") is 42
atoi("3.14159") is 3
atoi("31337 geek") is 31337 
stoi() vs atoi()

atoi() is a legacy C-style function. stoi() is added in C++ 11. 
 
atoi() works only for C-style strings (character array and string literal), stoi() works for both C++ strings and C style strings
atoi() takes only one parameter and returns integer value.
int atoi (const char * str); 
stoi() can take upto three parameters, the second parameter is for starting index and third parameter is for base of input number.
int stoi (const string&  str, size_t* index = 0, int base = 10); 
 

Exercise 
Write your own atof() that takes a string (which represents a floating-point value) as an argument and returns its value as double.
